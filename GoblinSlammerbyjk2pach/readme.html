It can be used as a hero or unit.<br />
<br />
Attack animations means to use it as a melee Hero.<br />
Attack-1, Attack-2 and Attack-Slam: the rocket pod is thrown on the target<br />
Spell: To fire missiles; works with spells like Rockets<br />
Spell Throw: to use the gun. Works better with spells like shockwave or Healing spray<br />
Death: the goblin is ejected.<br />
Walk: I do not know how to create animated textures, sorry.<br />
Defend tag: simply swith the flares on.<br />
<br />
Of course I would appreciate the fact you give credits.<br />
Permission to edit the model is granted ofc, but it is same: my name somewhere in the credits could be nice from you.<br />
