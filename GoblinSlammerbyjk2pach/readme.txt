Goblin Slammer
By jk2pach

Description:
A little model made for a hero contest .
It can be used as a hero or unit.

Attack animations means to use it as a melee Hero.
Attack-1, Attack-2 and Attack-Slam: the rocket pod is thrown on the target
Spell: To fire missiles; works with spells like Rockets
Spell Throw: to use the gun. Works better with spells like shockwave or Healing spray
Death: the goblin is ejected.
Walk: I do not know how to create animated textures, sorry.
Defend tag: simply swith the flares on.

Of course I would appreciate the fact you give credits.
Permission to edit the model is granted ofc, but it is same: my name somewhere in the credits could be nice from you.
