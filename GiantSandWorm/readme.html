Important: This model takes alot of custom WE settings to make it work the way intended, I also made abilitys for it (sandbreath,Devour,eatTree,Hardenedskin,Earthquake,Slam,Hurlboulder) edited the breathofFire missile to look like sand) To see it in action with all event objects, abilities, sounds, ect.. take a look at the test map I made here:<br />
<br />

refer to the testmap to see how to import it into your map like its done in the test map.<br />
